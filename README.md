### Elijah Koulaxis

Incoming Software Engineer II @ **Microsoft** (March 2026)

Currently Software Engineer @ **Kaizen Gaming - Kaizen Labs**

I’m an engineer obsessed with understanding how things work under the hood. I love learning new things, I like hard problems, and building tools that make life easier. I embrace the grind, and never back down from a challenge.

Fun facts:

- Built [Replayer](https://www.replayer.online/)
- Obsessing over developer productivity, I **loooooooooooooove** building tools
- I use vim, *btw*, unironically
- Sometimes I stream while building things live
- Open-source contributions ([Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), Microsoft OSS)
- est.01 🇬🇷
